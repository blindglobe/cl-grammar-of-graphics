#+title: common-lisp interpretation to grammar-of-graphics


Incomplete implementation of Wilkinson grammar of graphics, and
graphics drivers based on it.

Provides:
- Implementation of grammar elements in terms of =CLOS= classes
  - Very incomplete
- Definitions of graphic driver interfaces in terms of =CLOS= classes
  and generic functions
  - Not implemented yet
- Graphic driver for =gnuplot=
  - Uses /gnuplot-interface/ package
  - Very incomplete
    
    
Development strategy:
- I implement features based on my current needs
- Current goal is to provide 2D plotting utilities for data stored in
  files
  
The architecture and public interface of this package are subject to
change.
