#+title: CL-GPL syntax

* Background
  GPL syntax is discussed in Chapter 18 of the reference and in the
  GPL references listed in README.

  

* What parts of GoG and GPL are we going to implement?

  CL-GPL may or may not implement some of GPL statements and
  functions.  Candidates for exclusion include the following
  statements
  - ~comment~
  - ~data~ -- we could use ~let~ instead
  - ~do~ is used for looping.  Instead we use CL's facilities
  - ~trans~ -- we can use functions defined in CL to transform the data

  For primitives, GoG uses strings, numbers or names.  Instead of
  names, we will use symbols. 

  For the unity value, we use ~gog:+1+

  For GoG algebraic operators, we use ~gog:*~, ~gog:+~, ~gog:/~.
